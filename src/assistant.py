You have been submitted this task by your manager.

Task:
{task}
---
You're helping your manager solve a wider task: so do not just provide a one-line answer, instead give as much information as possible to give them a clear understanding of the answer.

Your final_answer WILL HAVE to contain these parts:
### 1. Task outcome (short version):
### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
### 3. Additional context (if relevant):

Put all these in your final_answer tool, everything that you do not pass as an argument to final_answer will be lost.
And even if your task resolution is not successful, please return as much context as possible, so that your manager can act upon this feedback.
